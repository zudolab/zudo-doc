# CSS cutover B: wind candidate manifest, compiled.css pipeline, showcase global.css, and the lockstep safelist-gate rename

Owner: [#4440](https://github.com/zudolab/zudo-doc/issues/4440). Status: **pending port**. [Index and column meanings](README.md). [Binding decisions](../../../_temp-resource/4430-zfb3-migration/conventions.md).

Seed evidence: exploration maps `server-jsx.md`, `islands-nav.md`, `islands-content.md`, `css-wind.md`, `pkg-build.md`, `tests-ci.md`, `deps-docs.md` at the migration planning baseline; file/symbol inventory refreshed from prerequisite base `4026c213`. This inventory is a review checklist, not authority to edit files outside the issue Files section. Historical v2 constructs remain listed after mechanical prep so the final mapping is auditable.

## Utility/token and authored rewrite rows

| File | Original utility or CSS construct | Required disposition / review | Status and test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/zudo-doc/src/compiled.entry.css` | Authored cascade / reset / custom properties | W-CASCADE and locked reset; every utility overlap gets winner-before/after evidence | pending computed-style proof |
| `src/styles/global.css` | Authored cascade / reset / custom properties | W-CASCADE and locked reset; every utility overlap gets winner-before/after evidence | pending computed-style proof |

## Tests and completion evidence

No colocated test file in the initial selected-source inventory. Use the issue acceptance tests and add a focused test only for the relevant behavior.

Run the exact source-resolution and port-check commands from the conventions with this topic’s paths. Record command, result, version and remaining diagnostics. Required behavioral coverage: initial SSR, active updates, cleanup/disposal, relevant navigation and parser/prop failures. CSS changes require computed-style evidence from the verification owner; a green build is insufficient.

| Completion field | Owner must fill |
| --- | --- |
| Port-check / unit evidence | pending |
| RawHtml review verdict per site | pending (or verified none) |
| Deliberate DOM/class/behavior differences and cause | pending (or verified none) |
| Upstream issue/shim and removal version | pending (or verified none) |
| Browser/visual cases handed to #4468/#4475 | pending |
| Final commit / reviewer / date | pending |
